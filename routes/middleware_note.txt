Register middleware in `app/Http/Kernel.php` under $routeMiddleware:

'role' => \App\Http\Middleware\EnsureRole::class,
'is_admin' => \App\Http\Middleware\IsAdmin::class,
'is_verified_lawyer' => \App\Http\Middleware\IsVerifiedLawyer::class,

Then use in routes: Route::middleware(['auth','role:admin'])->group(...)
